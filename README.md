# APESExamples
Demonstrations of an Automated Probabilistic Echo Solver for acoustic backscatter

This package contains code to reproduce the examples, analyses, and figures
from "Automated probabilistic echo solving: a scalable Bayesian inverse approach
for fisheries acoustics" by Samuel Urmy, Alex De Robertis, and Christopher Bassett
(Journal, Volume, Issue, Pages, DOI).

The analyses in this package all use ProbabilisticEchoInversion.jl.
